MODEL: 
- should I be using the small world in which distance doesnt matter, or the one in which it matters?
- maybe include cases for more polarized or more centralized initial populations
- disable the posibility of creation of links between already linked (by square lattice) ppl

GUI: 
- try to fix p_link_creation so it shows like 0.smt instead of 10^smt
- add posibility for square lattice (square box that sets link_creation_p to 0)
- maybe separate generate opinions from generate connections
- maybe include separate window for showing long range links
- include fixed positions for the windows (idk if possible, right now they are taken from imigui.ini)
- add speed controller
